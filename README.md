# Project Alpa Repo
Respository for the SmartContracts for the Etherum blockchain programmed by Project-Alpa.

# MVP Contract

## Requirements for the Minimum Viable Product
* The MVP SmartContract is based on the standard template of ethereum.org and contains all default functionalities which are needed.

* When ETH are sent to the Smarct Contract, the same number of new Alpa Token (1:1) will be generated and the total supply will be increased by this.
Optional: If the generated tokens are sent back to the sender by the ETH.
* The ETHs received are forwarded directly to a defined ETH address.
* Frontend for SmartContract "Inputs" is solved via [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/).
* The external factors (input variables) are not realized by an oracle in the MVP, instead they are inserted into the contract solely via the frontend.
